# Frontend TTN Mapper Locator

![Main GH actions Workflow](https://github.com/bassadin/ttn-locator-frontend/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)

This is the frontend for the [ttnmapper-reader](https://github.com/Bassadin/ttnmapper-reader) backend API.

It is part of my [master's thesis](https://github.com/Bassadin/Master-Thesis-INM) at [HFU Furtwangen University](https://www.hs-furtwangen.de/) and is still in development.

## Development

To start the frontend:

-   Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in your values
    -   Docker setup for ttn locator backend coming soon
-   `pnpm install`
-   `pnpm run dev` to start the dev server
